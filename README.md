### Hi, I am Lars 👋

I am a full stack developer who loves to put it’s hands on new technologies. I work mostly with Javascript (Typescript, Node), PHP, Svelte, Bash, Xojo and a bit Dart and I develop web and desktop applications. But most of the time I fail to make them successfull, because I always started two new projects  meanwhile.

I live and work in [Dresden|Germany](https://w3w.co/benutzen.ehrlich.besorgen) and I run the company [Stadt.Land.Netz](https://stadtlandnetz.de) together with my best friend Marcus and a team of 10 talented and beautiful persons.

## Projects
[Notion2Web](https://github.com/VanDerLars/Notion2Web) is the software which runs this website. You can take a Notion HTML export and it turns it into a beautiful, themable website.

[Cruddiy-Extended](https://github.com/VanDerLars/cruddiy-extended) is a software which creates for an existing MySQL database a management interface and a REST-API. I forked it from the original devs, since they don’t maintain it anymore, so I do it and I maintain it.

[Xojo Intro](https://github.com/VanDerLars/xojo-intro) and [Xojo-Intro-JS](https://github.com/VanDerLars/xojo_intro_js) are two implementations of a step-by-step intro function for the Xojo programming language.
